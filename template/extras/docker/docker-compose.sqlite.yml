# SQLite doesn't require a Docker container - it uses a local file.
# This file is a placeholder. The database will be created at ./payload.db
#
# To use SQLite, simply run your application - the database file will be
# created automatically on first run.
#
# Note: SQLite is recommended for development only. For production,
# consider using PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
